## Local Network Port Scan Report

## Overview

This task was about scanning my local network to find open ports on devices in the `192.168.245.0/24` range. The goal was to get an idea of what services are running in the background and evaluate potential security risks.

**This was done on a Windows 11 machine running a Kali VM and a mobile hotspot connection.**

I used `nmap` for scanning, and the command I ran was:

```bash
nmap -sS 192.168.245.0/24
```
## Scan Results:

 `192.168.245.1`
Open Ports:

135/tcp - msrpc

139/tcp - netbios-ssn

445/tcp - microsoft-ds

902/tcp - iss-realsecure

912/tcp - apex-mesh

1040/tcp - netsaint

1057/tcp - startron

5357/tcp - wsdapi

MAC Address: 00:50:56:C0:00:08 (VMware)

This is my main Windows machine running common Windows services like RPC and SMB. A few unfamiliar ports (like 1040 and 1057) could be third-party services or tools. These might be worth a closer look, especially if this machine shouldn‚Äôt be running custom services.

üñ•Ô∏è `192.168.245.2`
Open Port:

53/tcp - domain (DNS)

MAC Address: 00:50:56:F1:A9:CB 

Port 53 suggests a DNS service is running. Could be a VM used for internal name resolution or testing.

üñ•Ô∏è `192.168.245.254`
Open Ports: None

State: All ports are filtered

MAC Address: 00:50:56:E4:B2:02 (VMware)

This host seems to be blocking most traffic ‚Äî possibly a firewall or router VM. Could also be a hardened system that drops packets silently.

üñ•Ô∏è `192.168.245.128`
Open Ports: None

State: All ports closed (reset)

Pretty quiet machine. Likely not running any listening services or just not accepting connections from this subnet.

Quick Analysis
The most interesting host is definitely 192.168.245.1, with a bunch of services exposed, including SMB (445) and NetBIOS (139). These are often seen in vulnerability exploits (EternalBlue, etc.) and should ideally be firewalled off if not needed.

The DNS service on .2 could be normal, but it‚Äôs always good to double-check who‚Äôs running it.

## Exporting scan result to HTML:

To convert the scan results into an HTML file for easier viewing or sharing, I followed this process:

### 1. Save the Nmap Output in Grepable Format

I used the `-oG` flag to export the scan results to a `.gnmap` file:

```bash
nmap -sS 192.168.245.0/24 -oG scan.gnmap
```
This creates a file called scan.gnmap with a simplified, grep-friendly version of the results.

## 2. Convert the Output to HTML Using Pandoc

Once the .gnmap file was created, I used pandoc to convert it into an HTML file:

```bash
pandoc scan.gnmap -o scan.html
```
This generated a clean HTML page containing the scan data. You can open it in any browser or share it easily.


```bash
pandoc scan.txt -o scan.html
pandoc report.md -o report.html
```
This is especially useful when preparing professional-looking reports from raw scan data.
